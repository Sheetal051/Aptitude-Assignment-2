Q: Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?
Ans:

To find the point where the line 2x + 3y = 0 meets the x-axis, we can set y = 0 and solve for x:
2x + 3(0) = 0 2x = 0 x = 0
So, the line meets the x-axis at the point (0, 0).

To find the point where the line meets the y-axis, we can set x = 0 and solve for y:
2(0) + 3y = 0 3y = 0 y = 0
So, the line meets the y-axis at the point (0, 0).

Therefore, the line 2x + 3y = 0 meets both the x and y-axis at the point (0, 0).
