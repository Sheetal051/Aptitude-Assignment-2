Q:Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these numbers & the square root of their sum.
Ans:
Let the two-digit numbers be $10a + (a-1)$ and $10(a-1) + a$, where $a$ is a positive integer.

Since the digits of the first number are reversed to form the second number, we can write the equation:

$$10a + (a-1) + 10(a-1) + a = x^2$$

where $x$ is an integer.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$11a + 9 = x^2$$

Since $x$ is an integer,we know that $x^2$ is a perfect square. The smallest perfect square that is greater than 9 is 16, so we can start by trying $x = 4$:
$$11a + 9 = 16$$

$$11a = 7$$

$$a = 7/11$$

But $a$ must be an integer, so this solution doesn't work.

The next perfect square is 25, so we can try $x = 5$:

$$11a + 9 = 25$$

$$11a = 16$$

$$a = 16/11$$
Again, $a$ must be an integer, so this solution doesn't work.

The next perfect square is 36, so we can try $x = 6$:

$$11a + 9 = 36$$

$$11a = 27$$

$$a = 27/11$$
Again, $a$ must be an integer, so this solution doesn't work.

The next perfect square is 49, so we can try $x = 7$:

$$11a + 9 = 49$$

$$11a = 40$$

$$a = 40/11$$
Again, $a$ must be an integer, so this solution doesn't work.

The next perfect square is 64, so we can try $x = 8$:

$$11a + 9 = 64$$

$$11a = 55$$

$$a = 5$$

This solution works! So, the two-digit numbers are:
$$10a + (a-1) = 10(5) + (5-1) = 54$$

$$10(a-1) + a = 10(5-1) + 5 = 45$$

The sum of these numbers is:

$$54 + 45 = 99$$
And the square root of their sum is:

$$\sqrt{99} = 3\sqrt{11}$$

So, the two-digit numbers are 54 and 45, and the square root of their sum is $3\sqrt{11}$.
