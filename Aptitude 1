Q: What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 litres?
Ans:
Initially, the milk to water ratio is 2:3, which means that for every 2 parts of milk, there are 3 parts of water.
Let's assume the initial quantity of water is 3x. Then, the initial quantity of milk is 2x.
We are given that the quantity of milk is 40 liters, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 40
x = 20
So, the initial quantity of water is 3x = 3(20) = 60 liters.
Now, we want to add some quantity of water to the mixture so that the milk to water ratio changes to 4:11.
Let's assume the quantity of water added is x liters. Then, the new total quantity of water is 60 + x.
The new milk to water ratio is 4:11, which means that for every 4 parts of milk, there are 11 parts of water.
We can set up the equation:

40 (milk) / (60 + x) (water) = 4/11
Cross-multiply:
440 = 4(60 + x)
440 = 240 + 4x
200 = 4x
x = 50

So, 50 liters of water should be added to the mixture to change the milk to water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11.
