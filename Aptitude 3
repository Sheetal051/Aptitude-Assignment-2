Q:a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?
Ans:
To find the positive integers a and b such that a^2 - b^2 = 19, we can use the difference of squares identity:
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
Since a^2 - b^2 = 19, we can set up the equation:
(a + b)(a - b) = 19
We know that 19 is a prime number, so it has only two positive integer factors: 1 and 19.
If a + b = 1, then a - b = 19, which means that a = 10 and b = -9, but we are looking for positive integers.
If a + b = 19, then a - b = 1, which means that a = 10 and b = 9.
So, the positive integers a and b such that a^2 - b^2 = 19 are a = 10 and b = 9.
